# Chinook Database Query Project

## Overview
This project involves querying the Chinook Database, which holds information about a music store. The goal is to assist the Chinook team in understanding their media inventory, customers, employees, and invoice information. This repository provides the necessary instructions and resources to set up the Chinook Database, along with two main components: mastering SQL concepts and creating a presentation with SQL queries and visualizations.

## Getting Started
To begin, follow the steps below to set up the Chinook Database on your local machine:

1. Download the Chinook Database SQL script from the repository.
2. Install a compatible SQL database management system (e.g., MySQL, SQLite, PostgreSQL).
3. Execute the Chinook SQL script in your chosen database management system to create the Chinook Database.

## Part 1: Main SQL Concepts Mastery
In this part, you will answer a series of questions to demonstrate your proficiency in essential SQL concepts. The questions are designed to ensure your understanding of SQL fundamentals.

## Part 2: Presentation
For the presentation part of the project, you will showcase your creativity and problem-solving skills using SQL queries and visualizations. Follow the guidelines below:

1. Create four complex SQL questions that involve at least one JOIN and one Aggregation.
2. Write SQL queries to retrieve the necessary data to answer each question effectively.
3. Use the retrieved data to build visualizations such as bar charts, histograms, or other types of plots.
4. Prepare four slides, each containing one visualization and a brief 1-2 sentence explanation.

### Sample Questions and Visualizations
Here are four sample questions that you can use as a starting point for your presentation:

**Question 1**: What are the top 10 best-selling tracks in terms of total sales revenue?

Visualization: Export query results to CSV and create a bar chart in Excel showing the track names and corresponding revenue.

**Question 2**: How does the average invoice total vary across different countries?

Visualization: Export query results to CSV and use a spreadsheet software to create a horizontal bar chart comparing average invoice totals for different countries.

**Question 3**: Which employee has the highest number of customers assigned to them?

Visualization: Export query results to CSV and create a pie chart using Excel to display the distribution of customers among employees.

**Question 4**: What is the distribution of sales by genre for a specific country?

Visualization: Export query results to CSV and create a stacked bar chart using a spreadsheet software to illustrate the sales breakdown by genre for a selected country.

*Note: These are just example questions, and you are encouraged to develop your own unique questions that demonstrate your skills and creativity.*

## Conclusion
The Chinook Database Query Project provides an opportunity to practice SQL querying and data visualization techniques using the Chinook Database. By exploring various aspects of the database, such as media inventory, customers, employees, and invoices, you can gain valuable insights. Use SQL queries and visualizations effectively to present your findings in a clear and informative manner. The provided instructions, sample questions, and visualization suggestions will guide you throughout the project.
