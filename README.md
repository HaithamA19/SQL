# SQL
In this project, you will query the Chinook Database. The Chinook Database holds information about a music store. For this project, you will be assisting the Chinook team with understanding the media in their store, their customers and employees, and their invoice information. To assist you in the queries ahead, the schema for the Chinook Database is provided below. You can see the columns that link tables together via the arrows.

You need to come up with 4 questions that you can answer with SQL. The questions must be complex enough to where the SQL used to answer it requires at least one JOIN and one Aggregation.

Your presentation should include:

Four slides
One visualization per slide (You can export your query results from DB Browser to a csv and use Excel or any other spreadsheet software to create an appropriate chart)
A 1-2 sentence explanation of each slide.

Instructions

You will need to follow the instructions to get the Chinook database up and running on your own machine and check that it is set up correctly. There will be two parts to this project.

1-The first part is a series of questions that will assure you have mastered the main concepts of SQL.

2-The second part is a presentation. You have the ability to be creative in the questions you ask. You will then write a SQL query to pull the data needed to answer your question successfully. Use the pulled data to build a visual (bar chart, histogram, or another plot) that answers your question.
